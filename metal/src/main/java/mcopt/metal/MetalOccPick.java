/**
 * Picks whichever of MetalTerrain's two exact paths is faster here: the split (occlusion) or Sodium's own draws. The split's
 * depth reload and hi-Z cost grow with the pixel count and shrink with memory bandwidth, what it saves grows with the scene,
 * so the crossover depends on the machine: on the M4 mini the split is 43% faster at 1920x1080 and 9-13% slower at
 * 3456x2234. A trial alternates the paths in blocks of BLOCK terrain frames and scores each by its median frame time (medians,
 * so a GC pause or chunk upload in one block can't decide it). The pick follows the sum of ln(split / plain) over every trial
 * at this size, not the latest one alone: which path wins changes with the view (one trial at 3456x2234 picked the split and
 * held it 8 s of a spin that plain won by 13%), and the sum weighs every view the trials saw. Trials run again when the
 * terrain pass changes size, which clears the sum, FIRST_RETRY after that and then at doubling gaps up to every RETRY.
