/**
 * -Dmcopt.own.mesh.tieGroups=true|verify (with -Dmcopt.own.mesh; default off): per section mesh, its identical-corner groups of opaque
 * quads (solid and cutout), for per-quad phase selection (PLAN-perquad-product.md §3.1, step P4). Nothing drawn changes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Key.</b> A quad's 4 corners as their compact position codes (x | y << 16 | z << 32; OwnPosTable keeps one code per distinct
 * float, so equal codes are equal decoded positions, exactPos included), sorted. A corner group is split by winding only when every
 * member is <b>certified simple</b> (certify: both triangles (0,1,2) / (2,3,0) nondegenerate, the 4 corners exactly coplanar, the two
 * triangles facing the same way, all exact in the decoded positions). Two certified quads with the same corners and opposite winding
 * lie in one plane with every triangle of one facing against every triangle of the other, so back-face culling never draws both at
 * a pixel: they never tie. Anything else (a self-intersecting or non-planar quad: REVIEW-tiegroups' bow-tie counterexample, sloped
 * fluid tops) groups by corners alone. On the captures this keeps the back-to-back leaves faces (77-85% of corner-only groups) out
 * while every non-certified pair stays grouped: S members 56-1,162 a snapshot (corners alone: 56k-274k).
 * <p>
 * <b>Groups</b> (build, mesh-relative): [solid units, cutout units, group count, then per group a header n | S | X and its n members
 * u << 6 | lq ascending], u the mesh's opaque unit (solid units first, as OwnTerrain.buildRecords lays out the records), lq the quad in
 * the unit. S: two or more members in one layer (the per-quad tie list's members); X: members in both layers. OwnTerrain.publish
 * writes them with absolute records (r << 6 | lq, R_n order) into the shared tie-group buffer, the section's block at Section word 7
 * (pad1; 0 = none), and sets the per-ID S bits. Block: [words after these two, group count], then the groups.
 * <p>
 * <b>Fail-closed.</b> pad1 = UNKNOWN (0xFFFFFFFF) when a section's groups aren't known (its mesh wasn't grouped: vanilla's store
 * path, or too large; or the worker's unit counts don't match the stored layers): a consumer must not split that section's opaque
 * quads between phases. Off entirely (ON false, logged) with -Dmcopt.metal.inFlight > 2: later()'s 3-frame delay, which keeps a
 * group block or an S-bit range from being reused while a frame in flight reads it, only covers 2 frames in flight.
 * <p>
 * <b>Cross-section</b> (Dir): a quad with a corner on or outside its section's bounds may coincide with a quad of another section,
 * which no mesh sees. Each such quad (build's edges) goes into a directory keyed by its exact world corners when its section is
 * installed (OwnTerrain.setSlot, render thread) and leaves it when the section changes; the directory counts the live cross-section
 * tie candidates (identical world corners, unless both certified with opposite winding). A consumer must use its ordered fallback
 * for any frame while that count, or the count of UNKNOWN sections, is above zero (OwnTerrain.tieFallback). The captures had none.
