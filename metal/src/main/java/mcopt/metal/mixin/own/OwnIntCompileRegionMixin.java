/**
 * -Dmcopt.own.int.compileRegionDrop: a section's compile task lets go of its RenderSectionRegion (the 27 section copies it compiled from,
 * plus the level and light engine) once doTask returns. Vanilla keeps the task as RenderSection.lastCompileTask until the section's next
 * compile or reset, and with it every region: ~78 MB of live heap at RD 16 (measured in heap dumps).
 *
 * No change in behaviour: in 26.3 doTask does the whole job before it returns (compile, setSectionMesh, the upload), the dispatcher's runTask
 * never runs a task again after doTask (its only re-queue is before it), and nothing but doTask reads the region. lastCompileTask is only
 * read by cancelTasks, whose cancel() on a finished task sets a flag nothing reads any more. Only the task's own field is written here
 * (the render thread may store a newer task in lastCompileTask meanwhile, so that field is left alone). A doTask that throws keeps it.
